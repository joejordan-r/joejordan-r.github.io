## Professional

### About
I am a Risk Manager. I calculate Solvency Capital Requirements and work across all Pillars of Solvency II to help insurers manage risk.

### Ethos
I focus on applying my knowledge and problem-solving skills to develop commercial solutions to problems. During my studies I developed an eye for detail and rigour and I’ve become accustom to managing and overcoming both the complexity and ambiguity present in performing one-off projects in order to deliver results.

### Experience
- I have spent 6 months as the only member of First Line working with a Partial Internal Model in R and navigating an IMAP.
- I have been responsible for delivering all aspects of the Standard Formula under Solvency II since December 2017.
- I have built an Recommendation Engine in R and deployed it to the JVM for a Java-Spring Web App using Renjin and Maven.
- I have worked on Pricing models for Motor Insurance

## Personal
I enjoy travelling, food, film and I am a fan of Jazz-inspired music.
